# Information Retrieval Practicals - SPPU

This repository contains the practical assignments for the **Information Retrieval** course as per the **Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU)** curriculum. The practicals cover a variety of techniques and algorithms in information retrieval, providing hands-on experience with data retrieval, ranking, indexing, and evaluation methods.

## Introduction

The goal of these practicals is to implement key **Information Retrieval** algorithms and gain a deeper understanding of the techniques that make efficient search and retrieval from large datasets possible. Through these assignments, students will develop skills in essential areas like search, indexing, ranking, and retrieval evaluation metrics.

## Practical List

1. **Inverted Index Construction**: Implement an inverted index for efficient text search.
2. **Vector Space Model**: Use cosine similarity to calculate the similarity between documents.
3. **TF-IDF Calculation**: Compute Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency for given documents.
4. **PageRank Algorithm**: Simulate Googleâ€™s PageRank algorithm to rank web pages based on hyperlinks.
5. **Boolean Retrieval Model**: Develop a Boolean retrieval system to support AND, OR, NOT operations.
6. **Evaluation Metrics**: Implement precision, recall, F1-score, and other metrics for evaluating retrieval performance.
7. **Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI)**: Reduce dimensions in a document-term matrix using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).
8. **Probabilistic IR Model**: Implement a probabilistic retrieval model for ranking documents based on probability.
